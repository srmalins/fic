The red-haired woman walked into the first floor of the Shiawase tower in downtown Seattle. Though she looked to be only 17 or 18 she was far older. She raised an eyebrow at the security guard by the door, who was holding a Spratley Stalwart SMG; the man in the black uniform did not react or acknowledge her. She walked up to the discrete desk at the rear of the open room at the first floor. 

"Can I help you?" the slightly man behind the desk asked her; he seemed slightly annoyed or irritated by her presence. 

"I'm here to see director Wada." She answered. 

"I'm sorry Miss," The man replied, "the company portions of the tower are closed to visitors today due to a minor incident last night." 

"I have an appointment." Angelica responded. 

"Director Wada has canceled all of his appointments for today, Miss." The man, now more than slightly irritated, told her. 

"I see." The woman with red hair and wearing a Vashon Island business suit said. She turned to leave and she was out of sight before the man realized she had left a card on the desk. It was not an ARO, augmented reality object, but a physical piece of linen paper. The text in a dark blue, almost black, font read

> Dr. Angelica Ito

> Security Analyst; Shiawase Security Services 

The back was the same color and read the same in Japanese. By the time the man had realized what it was the woman he had been talking to was nowhere to be seen. 

-----------------------------

Angelica walked into "Mama Rachel's" and proceeded to hang her coat in the coat closet by the door. From the dust, it appeared she was perhaps the only patron who knew what the small door was for and cared to use it. The ork woman on the other side of the door eyed the two visible firearms. The bouncer was wearing a red and black leather corset and matching leather dress that ended just above her knees. Her one tusk was not altogether pretty, but distinguished, and she held herself straight and did not balk when Angelica walked up to her. The ork bouncer had a scimitar at her belt in a silver and black leather scabbard. 

One by one Angelica checked the action of her three firearms and handed them to the ork who was obviously the security for the establishment. The Colt Government 2066 came from an under arm quick draw holster under her left arm. The Predator I, almost an antique, came from a holster on her right hip. And the Shiawase Arms Light Tactical pistol came from a concealed holster in the small of her back. The ork checked the safety on each and set them in a black crate on the table behind her; she nodded to the newly arrived guest that she could proceed.
