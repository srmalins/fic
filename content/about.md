# Hi there

We've all had the experience of reading a work of supposed fiction and
having a revelation about our own reality; at least I assume everyone
has this experience from time to time. The intent of this present work
is just to be a digital page to post my fiction writing in a more or
less centralized location so that I can refer to it in the
future. However, I am reminded of a quote by the mythic Mr. Kurt
Vonnegut:

> We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.

It is my hope that this work provides some entertainment or escape
from other seemingly more serious concerns. Perhaps, after a time, it
shall provide the elusive insight into the nature of our reality; or
maybe the insight is gained not in the reading but in the writing....

# Multiverse 

The stories here contained do not all take place in the same universe,
except that they are all written by a single author; but you know what
I mean. Some of the stories share a universe; it can be assumed that
all stories with the same characters share a universe without great
harm to continuity. 

## Shadowrun 

*Shadowrun* is registered trademark of The Topps Company, Inc. Stories
on this site that are tagged with the tag **sixthworld** take place in
a modified version of the *Shadowrun* universe and timeline. The
